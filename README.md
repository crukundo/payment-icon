# payment-icon
<h1>SVG icons for popular payment methods</h1>
<p>I got really tired of using the low-res gif's that most payment providers make avalable on their websites.</p>
<p>There are many great icon fonts out there, also ones including payment icons. But since rules in Denmark (probably also most of the EU) dictate that icons on e-commerce sites have to have to be official acceptance marks, this is an attemt to make a collection of afficial acceptance marks in color.</p>
<p>All icons are official acceptance marks of 2015 all downloaded from the providers website and converted to svg format.</p>

<p>Feel free to suggest any additional acceptance mark, or point out any outdated acceptance marks.</p>
